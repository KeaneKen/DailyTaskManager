## Note
If you want to run the code, make sure that all of the files are in the same folder, and run DailyTaskManagerSelection.java first

## Introduction
An assignment for good ol OOP (even tho this is the second one lol), the assignment is for us to create a Daily Task Manager in java using arrays, stack, and linked list 

## Environment Setup
- JDK (Java Development Kit) Version 23.0.2
- VSC

## Challenges
- This is my first time making a bigger scale project like this, so there's a lot collums, so it's kinda hard to keep track of which one belongs to where
- Honestly i asked chatGPT a lot here, because i'm still pretty new to these concepts
